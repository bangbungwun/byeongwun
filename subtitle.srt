[indistinct chatter]

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,827
Should we <font color = "orange"><FONT SIZE=30>do</FONT></font> one <font color = "orange"><FONT SIZE=30>mo</FONT></font>re?

24
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,269
[Frank] Did the Democrats show?

25
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,814
[Doug] They didn't disappoint.
Almost every member, sir.

26
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,849
- [Frank] Almost.
- I have a list of those who did.

27
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,402
My fellow congressmen, I do not
need the <i>Washington Herald</i>

28
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,906
to tell me that a scoundrel
lives in the White House.

29
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,700
I can see the Democrats are here.

30
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:51,862
They're eager to debate.

31
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,780
I say to the gentlemen on
the other side of the aisle...

32
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:56,539
- thank you.
- [Frank] Go.

33
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,792
[congressman 1] Should we
investigate the president

34
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,503
for crimes committed while
he was vice president?

35
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:04,422
- [Congress murmuring]
- I say, yes. Let's debate.

36
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,969
Let's debate this miscreant
all day and all night.

37
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,596
[indistinct chatter]

38
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,806
[congressman 2] Madam
Speaker. Parliamentary inquiry.

39
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,090
[McCarthy] The gentleman from Georgia

40
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,884
may state the nature of
his parliamentary inquiry.

41
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,886
[congressman 2] Do the rules
of the House not require

42
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,105
the president be formally
invited in order to attend?

43
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,556
[congressman 3] Madam
Speaker, if I may...

44
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,642
The Speaker recognizes the
gentleman from South Carolina.

45
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,820
The president is wearing
his congressional pin today

46
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,907
and is thereby welcome to
any and all proceedings.

47
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,325
[congressman 2] Madam
Speaker! Madam Speaker!

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,484
- [clamoring]
- [gavel banging]

49
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,703
Rules of the House state

50
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:36,914
that former members are
not allowed on the floor

51
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,999
when they have interest
in the matter under debate.

52
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,500
Madam Speaker,

53
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:45,005
the president has no interest or opinion
on the matter being debated today.

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,674
- [clamoring]
- [gavel banging]

55
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:48,790
[McCarthy] The House suspend.
The House will suspend.

56
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:53,180
Madam Speaker, I still do have the
floor, and I find it hard to believe

57
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,893
the president wouldn't have an
opinion on the matter being discussed.

58
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:01,021
If the good gentleman from Florida
would yield a portion of his time,

59
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:05,643
- I assure him it will satisfy his query.
- [clamoring]

60
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,530
I yield three minutes to the leader.

61
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,451
And I yield my time to the former
congressman from South Carolina

62
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,954
and the President of the United States.

63
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,914
- [cheering and applauding]
- [gavel banging]

64
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,327
Point of order! Parliamentary inquiry!

65
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,830
Parliamentary inquiry!

66
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,340
- Parliamentary inquiry!
- [gavel banging]

67
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,550
Mr. President. This is beyond the norm.

68
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,004
I don't care.

69
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,340
I don't care.

70
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:41,436
And I also do not care about
your investigative committees.

71
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,517
- [clamoring]
- No, that is not what I care about today.

72
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,772
- [gavel banging]
- [McCarthy] The House will cease.

73
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:55,235
That is not what I care about today.

74
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:02,415
I am on my way to the funeral
of an American patriot.

75
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,001
[congressman 4 groaning]

76
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,789
A good man, a husband...

77
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:13,211
a father... who was
beheaded on American soil.

78
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:19,141
And this chamber chooses to debate me?

79
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,142
[cheering]

80
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,602
- [McCarthy] The House will suspend.
- I asked to speak

81
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,648
to a full session of this chamber
and my requests were denied.

82
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,359
- Madam Speaker!
- Mr. President, you must yield the floor.

83
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,940
- I will not yield, Madam Speaker.
- [all cheering]

84
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,991
- Because I cannot wait.
- [applauding]

85
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:37,485
[gavel banging]

86
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,532
One of the murderers...

87
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,462
One of the murderers who
killed Mr. Jim Miller...

88
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,506
is still out there.

89
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,251
At large.

90
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,680
How much more proof do you people need?

91
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,175
[cheering]

92
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:06,188
I demand that every member
of this House take a stand.

93
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:09,983
Like FDR before, and Wilson before him.

94
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,194
I demand that this Congress

95
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:18,033
declare a formal declaration of war
against ICO, both here and abroad.

96
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,534
[congressman 1] Motion to adjourn.

97
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,152
- [congressman 2] Second!
- The House will adjourn.

98
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,789
- The president will cease.
- [Frank] I will not cease!

99
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:26,201
I will never cease.

100
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,628
I demand that this Congress
declare a state of war

101
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:36,384
has existed and does exist between
ICO and the United States of America.

102
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,722
And I demand that every member
of this House stay in this chamber

103
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:45,602
for as long as it takes, until
you bring my request to a vote.

104
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:51,024
Or you will all go down
in history as cowards!

105
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,567
Cowards!

106
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,903
The sergeant at arms
will remove the president.

107
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:58,531
Madam Speaker, I
repeat. I demand a vote.

108
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,277
I will not yield.

109
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,328
I will not yield.

110
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,950
- I will not yield.
- [gavel bangs]

113
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,349
Alleged terrorist Zachary
Hawthorne was killed by the FBI,

114
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,185
but Joshua Masterson is still at large.

115
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,646
While the Miller family mourns, the
hunt for the missing terrorist continues

116
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,815
and tensions are running high.

117
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,775
The president may be asking for war,

118
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,321
but it seems war's already
been declared on him.

119
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,233
[chanting in Arabic]

120
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,745
My fans.

121
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,422
FBI is looking into a multiple
shooting in Chattanooga.

122
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,127
- Reports have it gang related.
- No.

123
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,973
A private plane went down in
West Virginia. Mechanical failure.

124
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,100
A series of homes were
set on fire in Georgia,

125
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,476
most likely arson.

126
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:36,523
Uh... convenience store in North Carolina
exploded at about 4:00 in the morning.

127
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,734
- Where's the store?
- Uh, suburb outside of Raleigh.

128
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,604
The cause is still under investigation.

129
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,365
- I'll make an appearance.
- Yes, ma'am.

130
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,118
Just put it on the schedule so
the media has time to mobilize.

131
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,571
Yes, ma'am.

132
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,059
I take it the president has
declared war on Joshua Masterson.

133
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,221
He never should've
kicked me off that call.

134
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,772
But this morning isn't about politics.

135
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,232
[sighs] That's right.

136
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,194
We need to show some
compassion for the living.

137
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,272
[Conway] And respect for the dead.

138
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,245
[Doug] The family's agreed to a moment.

139
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,325
No press, no speeches, but we
should be able to pull something.

140
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,037
- Mr. President.
- Governor.

141
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,052
Do they not realize what
we've done for them already?

142
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,970
I pointed that out, sir, but...

143
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,514
the daughter's medicated and
very fragile at the moment.

144
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,550
All right.

145
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,345
[Frank] Mrs. Miller.

146
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,974
- I'm so very sorry.
- Thank you.

147
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,941
And I promise you,

148
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:06,488
I will not stop until everyone
responsible for this terrible tragedy

149
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,233
is brought to justice.

150
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,154
And I swear to you,
as God is my witness...

151
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,581
no one will ever harm you
or your family ever again.

152
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,627
The nation mourns with you
and your daughter, Mrs. Miller.

153
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,207
- Thank you. If you don't mind...
- Of course.

154
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:31,673
[Conway] Mr. President.

155
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,550
I'll be right along.

156
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,768
It's a busy day for you today, sir.

157
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,264
It's a sad, sad day.

158
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,315
It's a shame things didn't
turn out differently.

159
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,354
Yes. Well, some things are
bigger than the two of us, Will.

160
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,900
[Melissa] <i>I don't want him here!</i>

161
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,662
Calm down, Melissa. Please.

162
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,080
It's his fault. He's dead.

163
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,375
- Daddy's dead. He killed him.
- Please.

164
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,495
- [knocking on door]
- Give me a minute.

165
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,382
- Did you take your medicine?
- Yes. Okay? Yes.

166
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,585
Yes!

167
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:15,300
You do. You think about what you
would say on a day like today.

168
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,261
If a day like today were to happen.

169
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,646
[sniffles] But you let it pass...

170
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,982
because you know you have so
much more left ahead of you.

171
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,484
[inhales sharply]

172
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,688
So much to do together.

173
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:34,326
[sniffles] You think...
You think 40 minutes...

174
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,660
[sniffles]

175
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,954
- If we were late 40 minutes...
- [Claire crying]

176
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,332
Or two, or one...

177
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:44,544
Or if we went somewhere else
to eat... [inhales deeply]

178
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,788
[exhales deeply]

179
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:50,627
But to dwell in the past,
to live in what-ifs...

180
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:54,171
That wasn't my husband.

181
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,509
That wasn't us...

182
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,678
- Honey...
- Please.

183
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,723
Okay. Come on.

184
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:06,934
[sniffles]

185
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,020
I need to... [exhales]

186
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,485
I wanted to say about my father...

187
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,785
[sighs]

188
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,991
He was so strong... so brave.

189
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,830
My father was taking us to...

190
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,502
My father...

191
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,638
- Come on, baby. It's okay.
- My father...

192
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,801
You killed my father.
You're the reason he died.

193
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,394
[gasps] Melissa...

194
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,430
[sniffles]

195
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,524
- It's all right, Melissa. We understand.
- [shutters click]

196
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,688
[whispers] I hope you die
and she becomes president.

197
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,587
What did the girl say to you?

198
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:21,634
She said she hopes I die and
that you become the president.

199
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:34,321
Mr. Macallan, this is Deputy
Director Michaels from the NSA.

200
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:38,067
I'm literally in your office.
I believe we had a meeting.

201
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,622
[Doug] There's been raids as far up
as New York and down to the panhandle.

202
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,665
As of now,

203
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,544
Green's focusing in on the border
between Virginia and North Carolina.

204
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,379
Seth has a statement
ready for this afternoon.

205
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,255
No. The best statement is no statement.

206
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,293
Besides, I want Claire to be the
voice on this until we're ready.

207
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,920
Yes, sir.

208
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,723
- Quite a crowd out there.
- Well, we better bring Birch in first.

209
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,015
Yes, sir.

210
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,428
- [door opens]
- Congressman Birch.

211
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,229
Bob.

212
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,483
Well, that was a little bit of
history this morning, wasn't it?

213
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,860
- It certainly was.
- I couldn't see it any other way.

214
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,403
No disagreement from here.

215
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,071
Well, you know how the Republicans are.

216
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,615
Anything but a decision.

217
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,450
They mistake complaint for leadership.

218
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,285
Well, instead of a
committee to investigate you,

219
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,365
you got one to discuss your declaration.

220
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,457
All the way to election day.

221
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,501
Even if there's only a
handful of Republicans

222
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,544
with the grit and
spit to put up a fight,

223
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,962
we can control the conversation.

224
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,048
Get them talking about anything
but that goddamn article.

225
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,842
All right. Now, who from our side

226
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,677
- do we need to massage?
- Womack.

227
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,055
The declaration caught him off
guard. Had to keep him out of it.

228
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,808
It's his constituents that
actually fight the damn thing.

229
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,686
Well, let's call in the
honorable gentleman from Missouri.

230
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,766
- Oh, he's a bourbon man, isn't he?
- [Doug] Yes, he is.

231
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,949
- A stunt. Yes, I'm calling it a stunt.
- [Claire] Charlie, if I may...

232
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,077
Tom, please, what are you implying?

233
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:10,041
This request for a declaration
of war is yet another distraction.

234
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,877
And I've never been prouder of
the president than I am today.

235
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,672
I'm not denying what happened
to the Millers. It was a tragedy.

236
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,508
[Claire] No, but you are.
Because denying it is the tragedy.

237
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,134
[inhales] This is a pattern.

238
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,094
Your husband's
administration, Mrs. Underwood,

239
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,632
- continues to operate in the shadows.
- Tom...

240
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,685
I understand you believe in
the importance of your article.

241
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,098
And I agreed to come here today
and talk with you about it.

242
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,518
But we're fighting to
keep this country safe.

243
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:41,280
Mrs. Underwood, the White House has
yet to release one piece of information

244
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,284
about the attempted capture
of those domestic terrorists.

245
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,911
ICO terrorists, yes.

246
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:51,791
Reports from a few hours ago are
saying North Carolina or Virginia.

247
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,126
But that's all we have.

248
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,629
Well, we are circling
in, we're getting closer.

249
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,255
[stutters] I will tell you,

250
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,383
our intelligence community,
they are the real heroes.

251
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,471
Charlie, if we could get back to
my point, my sources confirmed...

252
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:05,757
[Claire] Tom.

253
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,684
Heather Dunbar, no friend
of mine or my husband's,

254
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,812
looked into these charges,
and cleared the president.

255
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,932
Cleared? Please.

256
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,151
The White House has not
had a single press briefing

257
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,612
since the <i>Herald</i> ran my article.

258
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,239
You keep saying the White
House isn't speaking about this.

259
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,276
I am sitting right here talking to you.

260
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,620
Not Remy Danton or Jackie Sharp.

261
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,162
Or Lucas Goodwin, either.

262
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,249
- [mouthing] What?
- [Rose] Excuse me. Lucas Goodwin, meaning?

263
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,369
I'm saying, me. I'm here.

264
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,257
And I don't know how many more
times we have to go over this.

265
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:44,135
You know, a Tom Hammerschmidt
article used to be

266
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,924
the first thing I would look for when
I opened the <i>Washington Herald.</i>

267
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,642
[Marshall] The Underwoods
are no longer campaigning.

268
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,810
- [scoffs]
- [Conway] They can call it what they want.

269
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,897
Well, if you think about the last
few days, what's in the air...

270
00:16:55,932 --> 00:17:00,151
It might not be such a bad idea for
us to take it one handshake at a time.

271
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,896
Or call it for what it is.

272
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,405
"Home and abroad."

273
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,824
The president is essentially
asking for permission

274
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,451
- to fight a war on our soil.
- We can't push back too hard.

275
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,945
We can't afford to look soft on terror.

276
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,080
[Brockhart] We can't look
the other way, either.

277
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,501
You of all people know where
this kind of talk leads.

278
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,330
[Frank on TV] <i>...ICO and
the United States of America.</i>

279
00:17:20,075 --> 00:17:22,623
Make sure the committee dealing
with the declaration of war

280
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,210
never gets to a vote.

281
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,590
We're not against
war, we're against his.

282
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,381
And I want you to
reach out to the Speaker

283
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,304
and find out who she's
putting on that committee.

284
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,604
We need to get back to
the president's crimes.

285
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,183
That's the story. It's the only story.

286
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,436
Anything else?

287
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,071
I have my script.

288
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,740
[Frank on TV] <i>I will not yield!</i>

289
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,277
<i>I will not...</i>

290
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,621
Harry...

291
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,340
I want to know what he
says and when he says it.

292
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:06,335
Our general isn't used to taking orders.

293
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,671
Will, one more thing.

294
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,759
- What?
- Your wife.

295
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,935
Okay, I know we opened up
this campaign on Pollyhop,

296
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,724
but it might be time to close it
down... or at least be more careful.

297
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,692
Well, what did they find out?

298
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:26,237
The home of the mother of the terrorist,
you know, the one they're looking for,

299
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,030
was vandalized last night.

300
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,367
Garage set on fire. Broken windows.

301
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,535
And, uh, Hannah...

302
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,163
well... she posted.

303
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,284
She was defending the mother online.

304
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,630
- When?
- This afternoon.

305
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:46,250
The timing is not good on this.

306
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,295
- I can show you.
- Not now.

307
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,673
[scattered applause]

308
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,932
[Brockhart] Thank you.

309
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,685
Governor Conway and I
are honored to be here

310
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,897
with the Miller family
and their closest friends.

311
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,769
I know the VFW was a big part
of Jim's life here in Knoxville.

312
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,612
With the help of
Homeland and our hotline,

313
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,698
we think that Masterson has crossed
into the southwest corner of Virginia.

314
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,568
Scott or Washington.

315
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,113
- [Doug] And?
- And...

316
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,033
Assistant Director Green?

317
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:23,502
We're relying on aerial support,
sightings and local law enforcement.

318
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,629
But we're fairly confident

319
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:27,048
we can have him pinned
down in the next 24 hours.

320
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,508
The president wants us
to be absolutely sure.

321
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:33,089
We can't have him getting away
again. Careers are at stake.

322
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:37,433
Everyone around this table is fully
aware of the gravity of the situation.

323
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,596
Good. The president will
be happy to hear that.

324
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,054
[Hannah softly] Okay. What
kind of kiss do you want?

325
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,716
- [Charlie whispers] Eskimo.
- In...

326
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,428
and out.

327
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,514
I'll be right back.

328
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,651
- You're angry.
- I am.

329
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,663
[sighs] I was asked a
question and I answered.

330
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,325
That's the least of it.

331
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,377
Okay, well, I don't want
to talk about it right now.

332
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,213
Are you trying to lose
this election? Are you?

333
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,924
Oh, Will, stop it.

334
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:37,636
This woman that you're defending...
Her son just cut someone's head off.

335
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,305
And he's still out there somewhere.

336
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,381
- Do you understand what this looks like?
- Stop it.

337
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:44,393
Do you want to know
why our son can't sleep?

338
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,472
He's eight years old,
and he can't sleep.

339
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,141
Because he's having nightmares.

340
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,820
Because he thinks there's a big
black dog running around the hotel.

341
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,154
- Dog?
- Yes.

342
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,032
He closes his eyes, and
he can hear it growling.

343
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,027
He's scared, Will.

344
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:09,829
I said what I said because
that woman is a victim.

345
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,289
We all are.

346
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:14,750
And it has to stop.

347
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,798
I want you to win.

348
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,678
Get yourself a drink.
I'll be right back.

349
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,270
[sighs]

350
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:46,115
[LeAnn] That's the mother.
And this is Hannah's response.

351
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,667
<i>She's not a criminal and should not
be punished for the sins of her son.</i>

352
00:22:50,725 --> 00:22:53,610
<i>We all, I know, reject the rhetoric</i>

353
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,008
<i>and actions of these damaged,
troubled young men.</i>

354
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,177
<i>What I mean is, this is
a time for reflection,</i>

355
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,262
<i>not aggression...</i>

356
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,265
So she's not condoning
it, but it is sympathetic.

357
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,017
Plays into the idea
that Joshua and Zachary

358
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,477
were just a pair of troubled
kids looking for a cause,

359
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,722
no different than some school shooter.

360
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,268
The post has been shared
over 100,000 times.

361
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,563
I want to talk with her.

362
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,656
- Hannah?
- The mother.

363
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:24,576
[inhales] We've been very
careful about where you appear.

364
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:27,906
- LeAnn, will you excuse us for a moment?
- Of course.

365
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,454
[door opens]

366
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,714
- [door closes]
- We need to dial up the terror.

367
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,508
And the mother can help us with that.

368
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,463
But that also means we
have to locate Masterson.

369
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:44,238
Soon.

370
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,972
Tom is waiting for me.

371
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,099
Well, you go on.

372
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,191
Francis...

373
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,487
I shouldn't have cried at the funeral.

374
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,283
- No, it played beautifully.
- Not for me.

375
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:16,663
Come with me.

376
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,126
Come on. Just tell him you'll be late.

377
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,808
- Mr. President.
- It's all right, Officer.

378
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,886
Ma'am.

379
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,147
May I have your scope?

380
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,144
Scope on your gun. I
promise I'll give it back.

381
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,484
Thank you. Come here.

382
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,916
Now, if you just hold the scope
a little a ways from your face...

383
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:06,213
and look down, straight down,
across the lawn... right to the gate.

384
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,679
- You see them?
- Hmm.

385
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:19,310
[Frank] Those people want a
voice. Some for, some against.

386
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:23,814
And they're looking back across the lawn,
toward this house and these windows...

387
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,948
and they're thinking,

388
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,821
"I wonder what the president and
the First Lady are doing tonight.

389
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,200
And will they be able to protect us?"

390
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,829
I should have been there.

391
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,547
Where?

392
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:45,008
When you got shot. I wish I was there.

393
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,545
Maybe I could've...

394
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,215
protected you.

395
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:56,263
You see, all those people want...

396
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:01,102
is someone to keep them from
what they're afraid to know.

397
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,735
And what are the president and
First Lady doing tonight, Francis?

398
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,988
Well, I believe Thomas
is waiting for you.

399
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,033
[officer] Thank you, sir.

400
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,519
[Frank] I'll see you in the morning.

401
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,793
[whispers] Do you have a smoke?

402
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,135
[Frank] Thank you.

403
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,059
[singing] <i>♪ I know what my
people are thinking tonight ♪</i>

404
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:48,690
<i>♪ As home through the
shadows they wander ♪</i>

405
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,237

<i>♪ I wonder what the

410
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,555
I've been looking for you.

411
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,848
I got hungry.

412
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,226
So I went down to the main kitchen.

413
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:27,110
That's a lovely group of
people you have down there.

414
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,898
If there's anything you
need, it can be brought up.

415
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,319
I didn't know what I needed
until I was eating it.

416
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:36,322
I heard the president's declaration.

417
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,699
Very compelling.

418
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,289
What did you really think?

419
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,209
It was almost like the real thing.

420
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,861
[sighs] The NSA has
good people. Very good.

421
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,239
- Too good.
- Not as good as you.

422
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,032
Good enough to find my algorithms.

423
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,410
That doesn't mean they knew
what we were using them for.

424
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,828
No, no.

425
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,121
One second, they send me
home, and then the next,

426
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,998
they tell me, "Come back!"

427
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:26,044
- They'll been watching me. This is a trap.
- Or the only way out.

428
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,379
God damn it.

429
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,375
- You want out?
- Don't you?

430
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,670
LeAnn...

431
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,925
we have done some illegal things here.

432
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,560
There are other campaigns.

433
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,771
- If you can get into the NSA...
- That's not possible.

434
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,940
Into their system, you can fix this.

435
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,644
- You're not listening to me.
- I am.

436
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,063
I know the Underwoods.

437
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,575
The only way that we
are gonna survive this...

438
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,861
is if they win.

439
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:01,990
- You can help them win.
- [sighs]

440
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,243
I know you can.

441
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,341
I got on the paper right
around the time you left.

442
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,808
[Tom] Did you start in Style?

443
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,184
Metro desk.

444
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,479
But then I did this
piece, a street fashion,

445
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:26,932
kids on the street thing.

446
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,651
- I'm surprised you asked for me.
- [inhales deeply]

447
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,522
Some people are being moved
around and off the team.

448
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,152
The Masterson story.
"War, what is it good for?"

449
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,447
[chuckles]

450
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,333
Were you ever interested
in investigative journalism?

451
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,829
If you ask me, if it's not
investigating, it's not journalism.

452
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:56,169
Word around here is you can
get anybody to talk to you.

453
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,383
After 8:00, with a
drink in their hands...

454
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:03,469
yeah.

455
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,684
[inhales deeply]

456
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,980
She's the one they say you called a...

457
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:17,983
you know.

458
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,329
I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.

459
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:27,368
[stutters] You're sort of a legend
and... articles on the president?

460
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,204
It'd be an honor to work
with you in any capacity.

461
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,458
To be part of this.

462
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,388
Did you find him? Did you?

463
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:43,432
It'll only be another moment.

464
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,809
Because I've done all I can.

465
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,472
Everything you told
me to. You know that.

466
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,057
They know that, don't they?

467
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,771
Mrs. Underwood.

468
00:30:57,398 --> 00:31:00,901
[Claire] I was hoping to
speak to Ms. Masterson.

469
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,070
Just the two of us.

470
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,908
[whispers inaudibly]

471
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,553
Is there a problem?

472
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,930
It is a bit extreme.

473
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,107
Expanding the no-fly
list to this extent.

474
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:38,274
The restrictions on visas alone is
unprecedented. How do we justify?

475
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:40,021
The White House counsel's
been all through that.

476
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,615
It's there in black and white.

477
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,992
We're virtually closing down our borders

478
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,828
- without any hard evidence to back it up.
- It's coming.

479
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:50,081
A lot of innocent people are
trying to get into this country.

480
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,868
They could be hurt by this.

481
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:58,882
A change in policy this
big, I want it done right.

482
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,135
[inhales] I want you
to let the world know

483
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,556
that if they want to continue coming
to this country for our hospitals,

484
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,560
our colleges, our golf courses
and God knows what else...

485
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:14,057
they're going to have to deliver more
than my head on the end of a burning stick.

486
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,277
Now look, Cathy, I know you have
well-earned relationships out there.

487
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,446
Long-standing.

488
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:23,114
I'm not holding back,
Francis. I have reached out.

489
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:26,660
Then I need you to reach further.
I want actionable intelligence.

490
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,829
I want to know where ICO
is, or at the very least,

491
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,914
that everyone's out there looking.

492
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,373
Are we clear?

493
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,459
We're clear.

494
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,579
Thank you, Cathy. I know
you won't let me down.

495
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,632
He's dead.

496
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,391
- Is that why you're here?
- We're still looking for him...

497
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:53,764
Because if he's dead, I want
to see him. To touch him.

498
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:57,190
I'm trying to help...

499
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,568
- Ms. Masterson, please.
- But he hasn't contacted me.

500
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:02,147
- [stutters] I wish he would.
- I understand. Calm down.

501
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,024
[sighs]

502
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:08,153
He's not a monster like they all say.

503
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,783
I lost him somewhere.
But he's not... [inhales]

504
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,746
But still, monsters
do exist, don't they?

505
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,545
I want my lawyer.

506
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,839
What for?

507
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,185
I'm sorry, I don't know why I said that.

508
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,723
[chuckles nervously] I don't
know why I say anything anymore.

509
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,605
I wanted to see you... to
ask you a simple question.

510
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,026
Didn't you know what was
going on in your home?

511
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,995
- Excuse me?
- You knew...

512
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,122
even before he went to Pakistan.

513
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,702
- I mean, you raised him.
- No.

514
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:01,081
No. He had some problems. He got lost.

515
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,335
- But no, nothing like this.
- But you saw what he did, didn't you?

516
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,431
- No.
- Would you like to see it?

517
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,142
We can show it to you, if you like.

518
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,846
No. Please don't.

519
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,767
[inhales deeply]

520
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,148
What he did to that
family, to that man...

521
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,361
What sort of person
would do such a thing?

522
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,866
[crying] He's my son.

523
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,459
[sniffling]

524
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,371
[sobbing] Oh, God.

525
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,751
I know. It's awful, isn't it?

526
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,462
[breathing shakily] Thank you.

527
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,553
When you leave today,

528
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:02,566
there will be some reporters,
some cameramen out there.

529
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,936
But you don't need to say very much.

530
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:10,233
You just need to ask
Josh to turn himself in.

531
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:18,164
There are so many hardworking
mothers and fathers out there.

532
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,243
This could've happened to any of them.

533
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:24,755
We are close to capturing
your son, Ms. Masterson,

534
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,507
and I will do my best
to have you see him.

535
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,669
[breathing shakily]

536
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,129
I want to go.

537
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,674
No one's keeping you.

538
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,529
But who did she put in? Who did
the Speaker put on the committee?

539
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,432
Mostly lifers, with secure seats.

540
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:46,818
We're two weeks out. It's
hard to say no to war.

541
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,021
[breathes deeply]

542
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,441
You and I have some things in common.

543
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:56,036
- We both dislike the president.
- No. I'm still a Democrat.

544
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:58,121
[chuckles] Who leans to the right.

545
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,999
Alex, you do actually
lean a little to the right.

546
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,751
Look, he's the commander in chief.

547
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,879
He's got all the authority he
needs to fight them where they are.

548
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,548
Well, there's one here. Out
there, right now, as we speak.

549
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,711
Well, I'm a big fan of
American law enforcement.

550
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,969
They'll find him soon enough.

551
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,764
We can't just let Francis
Underwood turn us into a nation

552
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:18,426
that's always looking
over their shoulder.

553
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,858
If you can get yourself
onto that committee,

554
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:26,642
I got a feeling the Chair will
give you all the time you need.

555
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,564
My driver will take you back
to your car. But, Congressman...

556
00:36:32,812 --> 00:36:34,438
this is your chance.

557
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:37,320
And I think you know it.

558
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,948
[crowd cheering]

559
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:53,593
Thank you so much for coming out here.
Thank you so much for coming out.

560
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,256
- Great to see you. Thanks for coming out.
- [cheering]

561
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,387
[reporters clamoring]

562
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,931
[Roseanne] Just go away!

563
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,531
You have no idea what is
happening in your own homes.

564
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:18,361
[reporter] Have you any idea
where he is, Mrs. Masterson?

565
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,572
Josh, please...

566
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:26,036
please, please turn yourself in.

567
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:30,331
- This has all got to stop. No, no.
- [reporters clamoring]

568
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,429
- [keypad beeps]
- [door unlocks]

569
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,356
[indistinct chatter]

570
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:14,876
[keypad beeps]

571
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,587
[sighs]

572
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,188
[keypad beeps and buzzes]

573
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,732
- [buzzing]
- [scoffs]

574
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:42,946
[indistinct chatter in distance]

575
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,837
this after ten years with
Treasury, he was waiting for it.

576
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,248
[man sighs] Yeah...

577
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,792
[sighs heavily]

578
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:07,762
[mouse clicks]

579
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:36,374
[exhales heavily]

580
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,089
[sighs]

581
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,706
[reporters clamoring]

582
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,443
- [all clamoring]
- Mrs. Underwood!

583
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:40,403
Mrs. Underwood!

584
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,114
Does the administration believe
that the explosion was connected

585
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,617
- with Joshua Masterson somehow?
- We're not sure yet.

586
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,329
Uh, there is strong evidence to suggest.

587
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,706
The owner of the
establishment was foreign-born.

588
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:54,334
Any connection to ICO overseas?

589
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,593
I think our Deputy Director Clark
here is better equipped to answer that.

590
00:40:58,596 --> 00:41:01,718
We're looking into it. In the
meantime, we've set up a hotline.

591
00:41:01,721 --> 00:41:04,877
- If anyone in the community has any...
- And if the Republican candidate

592
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:07,138
and the rest of his party
refuse to acknowledge

593
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,016
the seriousness of the
threat made here at home...

594
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,684
know that we will.

595
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:16,314
The FBI is currently gathering
a list of words and images.

596
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:20,944
If they appear on your children's
or your coworkers' devices, please...

597
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,189
- [man] War whore!
- [people gasp]

598
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,740
- [officer 1] Move!
- [officer 2] Car!

599
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,777
- [agents clamoring]
- [camera shutters clicking]

600
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,447
[breathing heavily]

601
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:37,662
[Doug] It was just
paint. She's all right.

602
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,250
And what else? Spit it out,
Doug. It won't taste so bad.

603
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,718
Sir, I know you
disagree with me on this.

604
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,054
But Director Green and
his team have a location

605
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,630
for the takedown and
they're ready to act.

606
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,516
And they're positive
it's the right location?

607
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,552
- Adamant.
- When?

608
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,679
Hours.

609
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:00,483
We can coordinate out
of the Situation Room.

610
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,395
Oh, no. I'm gonna meet him in person.

611
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,897
Sir, I strongly advise against that.

612
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,775
Duly noted, but I'll be on-site.

613
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,777
Yes, sir.

614
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,660
[door closes]

615
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,465
It's amazing how ready
people are to be afraid.

616
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,752
History would prove them right.

617
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,638
[sirens blaring in distance]

618
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,391
You're lucky this is
coming off with water.

619
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,635
Could've been worse.

620
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,056
Some found its way behind your ear.

621
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:44,104
- Should I be afraid?
- Don't be smart.

622
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,189
I should, shouldn't I?

623
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,775
I stole something from you.

624
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,611
What?

625
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,406
What it is, doesn't matter.

626
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,993
I just wanted something that was yours.

627
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,745
Well, put it back.

628
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:06,334
Waterfalls.

629
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:10,553
The NSA marked their zero-day
exploits as waterfalls.

630
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,513
What can they get us into?

631
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:16,976
We can backdoor into some
very popular social media.

632
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,723
I can insert anything your imagination
can think of into those sites.

633
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,018
<i>Underwoods or otherwise.</i>

634
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,186
[reporter on laptop] <i>...reports coming
in from a variety of sources</i>

635
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,906
<i>stating that local police
enforcement and FBI agents</i>

636
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,616
<i>are currently on the ground.</i>

637
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:33,743
<i>We're receiving reports
that there's a great deal</i>

638
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,578
<i>of police activity on
the Virginia border.</i>

639
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,372
<i>We cannot confirm at this time,</i>

640
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:39,999
<i>but we believe this is
connected to the manhunt</i>

641
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,120
<i>for domestic terrorist
Joshua Masterson.</i>

642
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:02,272
The capture of Joshua
Masterson may be close at hand.

643
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:06,359
The FBI is still not commenting,
but if you look at this aerial view,

644
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,939
you can see heavily-armed men making
their way through this wooded area.

645
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:36,882
[indistinct radio chatter]

646
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,557
[FBI agent] Sir, he's not here.

647
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:49,444
All we have are some
loose domestic connections.

648
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:52,780
A perverse idolization of ICO overseas.

649
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:56,319
He refuses to confirm any
wide-ranging homegrown network.

650
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:01,163
Our interrogators are confident
the asset is no longer valuable.

651
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,076
And risk to reward no longer tenable.

652
00:45:05,995 --> 00:45:09,374
Sir, we have reached a breaking point.

653
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,388
Did you think I didn't already have him?

654
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,800
That I would have left
him out there somewhere?

655
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:22,720
And I thought you knew me.

656
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,086
Josh.

657
00:45:58,423 --> 00:45:59,882
Joshua.

658
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,315
Do you want to live?

659
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,695
Tell us what we want.

660
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:25,199
Tell us what we want to hear.

661
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,079
You're no martyr, are you?

662
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,665
[scoffs] Look at you.

663
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,918
No, you're not a martyr.

664
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:42,425
No one will remember what you've done,
either here on Earth or in your heaven.

665
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:49,974
[sighs]

666
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,977
So why did you pick the Millers?

667
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:57,189
Why?

668
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,775
What did you see?

669
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,740
[softly] Was it the girl?

670
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,661
Did you see her first?

671
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,289
What did you see?

672
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,087
Or did she see you first?

673
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:25,801
Yeah, that's it, isn't it? She saw you.

674
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,724
- She looked right through you, didn't she?
- [breathing heavily]

675
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,604
I don't need to see this person anymore.

676
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,357
- Get rid of the asset.
- [Green] Sir.

677
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,160
He's an animal, but he's
still an American citizen.

678
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:49,366
[Frank] We are at war. And
he is an enemy combatant.

679
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:53,252
And he lost whatever rights he
might have had as an American

680
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,171
when he cut that poor man's head off.

681
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:59,293
So don't give me your
pride or your position.

682
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,636
Because none of this would have happened

683
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:04,173
if you'd done what you were
told in the first place.

684
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,098
I'll take care of it.

685
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,261
Yes, you will, and you
will do so willingly.

686
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:15,400
And I want you to get some
good, usable footage...

687
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:16,936
of his killing.

688
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,397
And then destroy everything else.

689
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:42,462
[Frank] <i>We will be releasing footage
of Joshua Masterson's killing.</i>

690
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:45,513
The administration and
the intelligence community

691
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,390
were hoping to take him alive.

692
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,559
But I would like to commend

693
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:52,352
Assistant Director of
Counterterrorism, Nathan Green.

694
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:53,563
And of course all of the work

695
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:56,476
that Secretary Durant has done
behind the scenes on all of this.

696
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,736
The information the
investigation has gathered so far

697
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,614
points to Joshua Masterson
and Zachary Hawthorne

698
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:08,953
having strong connections to ICO abroad
and ICO's growing network domestically.

699
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:12,658
And so I would like to
say this to ICO directly.

700
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:17,037
You will not infect the mind
of one more of our young people,

701
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,875
because I will not
stop until I find you.

702
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,218
And I say that for the
grieving Miller family,

703
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:27,638
whom I hope will find
some sleep tonight.

704
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,724
I also urge Congress

705
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:34,311
to accelerate the process and vote on
my request for a declaration of war.

706
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,981
- [reporters] Mr. President?
- I will not be answering questions.

707
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:38,816
Seth will take it from here.

708
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,604
- [reporters clamoring]
- [Seth clears throat]

709
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:45,948
[phone ringing]

710
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,618
- [reporter speaking indistinctly on TV]
- [gunshots on TV]

711
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,245
[reporter] <i>It's hard to see,
but I think that was the killshot.</i>

712
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,873
<i>Now, please remember, these
reports are unconfirmed</i>

713
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,501
<i>and we're waiting on a
statement from the White House.</i>

714
00:49:56,536 --> 00:49:59,837
<i>- What we can report is a great deal...</i>
- Why are you watching this?

715
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:02,882
<i>This wooded area. And shots
being fired, both by and...</i>

716
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:03,924
Hello?

717
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,211
[Frank] <i>Hello. This is Francis Underwood.</i>

718
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,806
It's him.

719
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,226
The committee is looking for
Remy Danton and Jackie Sharp.

720
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,219
What do either of them have
to do with ICO or the war?

721
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:18,523
The talk up on the Hill is
they're going to invite you

722
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:20,643
and the rest of your staff to testify.

723
00:50:21,526 --> 00:50:23,936
They're gonna use the
Declaration of War to investigate.

724
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,105
That's right.

725
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:30,367
They're gonna use the committee
Frank asked for to investigate him.

726
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,994
- Fuck.
- That's right, Doug.

727
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,488
"Fuck."

728
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:43,021
[Frank] It's difficult to underst...

729
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,884
Well, perhaps if you could
just calm down for a moment.

730
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,170
[Caroline] <i>Please stop it.</i>

731
00:50:48,762 --> 00:50:51,639
[Frank] I thought this news
would bring you some relief.

732
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:52,923
The president called Mrs. Miller.

733
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,892
I promised you and your
daughter that I would...

734
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,220
<i>Leave her alone.</i>

735
00:50:56,929 --> 00:51:00,064
Well, perhaps we should speak when
you're feeling a little more up to it.

736
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,817
<i>I don't want to hear you. Or from you.</i>

737
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:05,485
<i>- What you did to my family...</i>
- What?

738
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,656
<i>Leave us out of it. And do
not use my husband's name.</i>

739
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:10,234
- Listen, Mrs....
- [dial tone]

740
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,487
She hung up.

741
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:18,033
[sighs]

742
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,369
Let's go for a walk.

743
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:44,727
- [all clamoring]
- [man] Mr. President!

744
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,948
Tell them what they need to know.

745
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,902
[all clamoring]

746
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,326
[man] Mr. President!

747
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:03,871
[Frank] Hello.

748
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,960
[man] Mr. President.
Thank you, thank you.

749
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,379
[Frank] Hello.

750
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,384
You have nothing to be afraid of.

751
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,888
You have nothing to be afraid of.

752
00:52:22,462 --> 00:52:24,422
You have nothing to be afraid of.
